# Homework 8

Create a UTF-8 encoded text file called `mytext.utf8`.
Write a Java program to read the UTF-8 encoded file, translate the text to UTF-16, and dump out this text in a file called `mytext.utf16`. 
Run the same Java program, feeding it the UTF-16 encoded file this time.
Ensure that the program barfs appropriately.
