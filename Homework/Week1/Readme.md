# Homework 1

Write a class with a main method that contains members of type:

  1. int
  2. byte
  3. short
  4. long
  5. float
  6. double
  7. boolean
  8. char
  9. int[]
  
This class should have methods:

1. getMyInt()
2. getMyByte()
3. ...
9. getMyIntArray()

And each of those methods should print out the value you assigned to the member variable.For getMyIntArray() you will need a loop to loop over the array and print each int.

The class should also have methods:
1. useAnIfElseStatement()
2. useAWhileLoop()
3. useAndComparator()
4. useOrComparator()

Method (1) contains and if{} else{} statement.
Method (2) contains a while loop
Method (3) contains the && operator
Method (4) contains the || operator
