# Homework 3 - Inheritance and Interfaces
After you complete this assignment you will have proven to me and to yourself that you understand interfaces and inheritance!

## Problem 1
Write some Java that uses the *implements* and *extends* keywords. In the main() method of your code, you should make the object that implemented an interface do something. You should also make the object that extended somethign do something.

This assignment is fairly open ended, you just need to show me that you can so something with an interface and something with inheritance.

## Problem 2
Write some Java code that has a class with two child classes. BaseClass <- Child 1 <- Child 2. Put a *System.out.println("Called Constructor BaseClass()");* or *System.out.println("Called Constructor Child1()");* or *System.out.println("Called Constructor Child2");* in the respective constructors. When you run "Child2 child = new Child2();" in your main(), what is the output? Include the output as a comment in the code you submit.

## Submission Guidelines
Due promptly by 6:59:59 on 9/25/19 and not a second later!
