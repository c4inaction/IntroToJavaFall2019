## Interfaces and Inheritance
A crucial concept in programming
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/index.html

[ For the lab have students experiment with Interfaces and inheritance. When are methods overriden? How do you know which
method will be called if you call ChildClass.MethodImplementedInParent() ? How does multiple inheritance work if two parent 
classes define the same method?]

How does Java handle the diamond problem?
