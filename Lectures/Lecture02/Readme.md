# Lecture 2

As there are likely some new students ( usually a few students miss the first class, or one or two will drop and then a wait-lister will come in ) we are going to rehash some of the stuff from the first lecture. The purpose of this class is for you all to become great Java programmers, so I want to make sure we're all on the same page as much as possible. 

## Review the basics of Java

## Classes and Objects - Huge concepts in Java!!
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/index.html
( Can we cover lambdas and put them to good use here? )

## Bitwise operators

A more indepth look at bitwise operators

[For the in class lab, have students parse binary data like I do for work!]

This bitwise stuff is not the essence of Java, but I'm teaching you in lecture 2 because it doesnt fit into the course at a later time and it's super cool. It's going to be on the Midterm 5 weeks from now, so I'm giving you this little taste becasue I really enjoy this stuff and I suspect many of you are somewhat computer savvy but have never seen low level bit manipulation, and you must know this.
