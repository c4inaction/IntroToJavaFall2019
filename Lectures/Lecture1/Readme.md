# Introduction to Java
This may be your first programming course - or it may not - either way, this is a great class to take. Java is a widely used language for building mobile apps ( android apps are written in Java and related languages ), websites ( Java is used for many popular website backends as well as applets ), desktop applications ( many desktop applications are written in Java because it gives you some great features ) and the uses go on and one. Furthermore, Java looks remarkably like alot of different languages - so if you go to write a C program to run on a microprocessor ( like Arduino, for example ), it looks like Java. If you write a C++ based desktop application  - well C++ looks like Java too. If you want to write an XBox game, you'll probably write it in C# - and C# is practically Java. The reasons why its a good idea for you to learn Java go on and on. 

Computers are tools for doing things, if you didn't know that yet. Programming languages are used for writing code, with which you can make the computer do what crazy things you dream up. I'll just take a minute to show you some Java code that does some really amazing stuff. 

## Demos
1. Guitar sound frequency analyzer
2. Astronomy demo
3. Math demo
4. Website whose backend is Java.
5. Beaglebone driving a servo with Java.

So as you can see, if you know Java you'll be able to do lots of cool stuff. 

## About the course 
This is a Java programming class - as such I'm going to teach you how to write Java in this class. I'm going to point you to some outside references about Java and from time to time ask you to read them. I'm assuming that you're here because you want to write code and make computers do stuff! I've shown you now a sampling of what you can do with Java, and hopefully you're amazed! For you to be empowered to do these cool things, there's alot to know about Java, software, and computers in general. I'm going to teach you the basic stuff you need to know, and once or twice during the semester I'm going to make you sweat a bit and do something cool with the language - you've been warned!

A common trend in the tech world is to teach yourself. It's 100% possible to read the technical books and practice on your free time and become a good programmer. Nevertheless, it's a very good idea for you to be in this class if you are serious about becoming a programmer, or even if you are a history major with a bit of unsatisfied curiosity about technology. I've been working in this field for about a decade and I've done some cool stuff during that time. Many things I've learned I'm going to pass on to you - but more than that you're in a dedicated environment for a few months to learn Java. All things about Java. If you drop this class and read the how to book in your free time your pace will probably be slower, you won't have expert guidance during the process, and you  won't have a community of peers sitting in the same room as you thinking about the same thing! When you leave here I expect you to know Java - not to have thumbed through a book on a Saturday night a few times and have a few words memorized  - when you leave here, you will KNOW JAVA! And, as I've mentioned, you'll also have alot of insight into other languages like C, C#, C++, Python, Scala, Kotlin, and beyond. You'll be on your way to understanding web backends, GUI programming, Mobile App development, etc.. 

So I'm glad you're here. If you've got the time to make it to lectures, do the assignments, and read the materials, you'll be going on your winter vacation being a much more capable, talented, intelligent person than you are in this moment. So I'm glad you're here, and you're in for a treat this semester.

There's alot of material to cover. Let's write a program now to get started.

## Hello World in Java
Write a Java program in a text editor and compile on the command line.
Talk about classes, compilers, and what we just did.

## BREAK

## Cover a few more language features.

...As this is the first class, we'll probably have to rehash everything from this lesson the next week in the beginning of the lecture...

... Must remember that this is an intro class, most people have never programmed before ... But at the same time, this is a programming class and, as such, students must write and understand programs!!...
